# Data Engineering Project 1

This project is an example of data engineering, which involves creating a database to store and manipulate data. The goal of this project is to create a database with tables for account countries, account data, and account series.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need to have Python 3 installed. You will also need to install the **`psycopg2`** and pandas **`libraries`**. You can do this by running the following commands:

```

pip install psycopg2
pip install pandas

```

## Usage

To create the database, open the **`data_engineering_project_1.ipynb`** file in Jupyter Notebook and run the code. This will create tables for account countries, account data, and account series, and populate them with data.
